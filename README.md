# Grey-Machine-Learning
The original source code of the grey machine learning models

The grey machine learning is quite efficient in nonlinear time series forecasting.

To know what it is, how to use implement your own Grey Machine Learning Models, you can check the original paper of the grey machine learning. 

The original studies of the grey machine learning model are shown online https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2017.12.010.
